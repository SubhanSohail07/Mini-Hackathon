                                <p>One of the best-known personal bloggers (those who provide more of a diary than a
                                    soapbox or reporting service), Heather Armstrong has been writing online since 2001.
                                    Though there were personal websites that came before hers, certain elements
                                    conspired to make Dooce one of the biggest public diaries since Samuel Pepys's
                                    (whose diary is itself available, transcribed in blog form, at Pepysdiary.com).
                                    Primarily, Armstrong became one of the first high-profile cases of somebody being
                                    fired for writing about her job. After describing events that her employer - a
                                    dotcom start-up - thought reflected badly on them, Armstrong was sacked. The
                                    incident caused such fierce debate that Dooce found itself turned into a verb that
                                    is used in popular parlance (often without users realising its evolution): 'dooced -
                                    to be fired from one's job as a direct result of one's personal website'.

                                    Behind Dooce stands an army of personal bloggers perhaps not directly influenced by,
                                    or even aware of, her work - she represents the hundreds of thousands who decide to
                                    share part of their life with strangers.

                                    Armstrong's honesty has added to her popularity, and she has written about work,
                                    family life, postnatal depression, motherhood, puppies and her Mormon upbringing
                                    with the same candid and engaging voice. Readers feel that they have been brought
                                    into her life, and reward her with their loyalty. Since 2005 the advertising revenue
                                    on her blog alone has been enough to support her family.</p>
