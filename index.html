                            <h1>The Huffington Post</h1><br><br>
                            <blog>
                                <p>The history of political blogging might usefully be divided into the periods pre- and
                                    post-Huffington. Before the millionaire socialite Arianna Huffington decided to get
                                    in on the act, bloggers operated in a spirit of underdog solidarity. They hated the
                                    mainstream media - and the feeling was mutual.
                                    Bloggers saw themselves as gadflies, pricking the arrogance of established elites
                                    from their home computers, in their pyjamas, late into the night. So when, in 2005,
                                    Huffington decided to mobilise her fortune and media connections to create, from
                                    scratch, a flagship liberal blog she was roundly derided. Who, spluttered the
                                    original bloggerati, did she think she was?

                                    But the pyjama purists were confounded. Arianna's money talked just as loudly online
                                    as off, and the Huffington Post quickly became one of the most influential and
                                    popular journals on the web. It recruited professional columnists and celebrity
                                    bloggers. It hoovered up traffic. Its launch was a landmark moment in the evolution
                                    of the web because it showed that many of the old rules still applied to the new
                                    medium: a bit of marketing savvy and deep pockets could go just as far as geek
                                    credibility, and get there faster.

                                    To borrow the gold-rush simile beloved of web pioneers, Huffington's success made
                                    the first generation of bloggers look like two-bit prospectors panning for nuggets
                                    in shallow creeks before the big mining operations moved in. In the era
                                    pre-Huffington, big media companies ignored the web, or feared it; post-Huffington
                                    they started to treat it as just another marketplace, open to exploitation. Three
                                    years on, Rupert Murdoch owns MySpace, while newbie amateur bloggers have to gather
                                    traffic crumbs from under the table of the big-time publishers.</p>

                                <p>Lego reconstructions of pop videos and cakes baked in the shape of iPods are not
                                    generally considered relevant to serious political debate. But even the most earnest
                                    bloggers will often take time out of their busy schedule to pass on some titbit of
                                    mildly entertaining geek ephemera. No one has done more to promote pointless, yet
                                    strangely cool, time-wasting stuff on the net than the editors of Boing Boing
                                    (subtitle: A Directory of Wonderful Things). It launched in January 2000 and has had
                                    an immeasurable influence on the style and idiom of blogging. But hidden among the
                                    pictures of steam-powered CD players and Darth Vader tea towels there is a steely,
                                    ultra-liberal political agenda: championing the web as a global medium free of state
                                    and corporate control.

                                    Boing Boing chronicles cases where despotic regimes have silenced or imprisoned
                                    bloggers. It helped channel blogger scorn on to Yahoo and Google when they kowtowed
                                    to China's censors in order to win investment opportunities. It was instrumental in
                                    exposing the creeping erosion of civil liberties in the US under post-9/11 'Homeland
                                    Security' legislation. And it routinely ridicules attempts by the music and film
                                    industries to persecute small-time file sharers and bedroom pirates instead of
                                    getting their own web strategies in order. It does it all with gentle, irreverent
                                    charm, polluted only occasionally with gratuitous smut.

                                    Their dominance of the terrain where technology meets politics makes the Boing Boing
                                    crew geek aristocracy.</p>

                            <blog>
                                <p>Techcrunch began in 2005 as a blog about dotcom start-ups in Silicon Valley, but has
                                    quickly become one of the most influential news websites across the entire
                                    technology industry. Founder Michael Arrington had lived through the internet
                                    goldrush as a lawyer and entrepreneur before deciding that writing about new
                                    companies was more of an opportunity than starting them himself. His site is now
                                    ranked the third-most popular blog in the world by search engine Technorati,
                                    spawning a mini-empire of websites and conferences as a result. Business Week named
                                    Arrington one of the 25 most influential people on the web, and Techcrunch has even
                                    scored interviews with Barack Obama and John McCain.

                                    With a horde of hungry geeks and big money investors online, Techcrunch is the
                                    largest of a wave of technology-focused blog publishers to tap into the market -
                                    GigaOm, PaidContent and Mashable among them - but often proves more contentious than
                                    its rivals, thanks to Arrington's aggressive relationships with traditional media
                                    and his conflicts of interest as an investor himself.</p>

                            <h1>Kottke</h1><br><br>
                            <blog>
                                <p>One of the early wave of blogging pioneers, web designer Jason Kottke started keeping
                                    track of interesting things on the internet as far back as 1998. The site took off,
                                    boosted partly through close links to popular blog-building website Blogger (he
                                    later married one of the founders). And as the phenomenon grew quickly, Kottke
                                    became a well-known filter for surfers on the lookout for interesting reading.

                                    Kottke remains one of the purest old-skool bloggers on the block - it's a selection
                                    of links to websites and articles rather than a repository for detailed personal
                                    opinion - and although it remains fairly esoteric, his favourite topics include
                                    film, science, graphic design and sport. He often picks up trends and happenings
                                    before friends start forwarding them to your inbox. Kottke's decision to consciously
                                    avoid politics could be part of his appeal (he declares himself 'not a fan'),
                                    particularly since the blog's voice is literate, sober and inquiring, unlike much of
                                    the red-faced ranting found elsewhere online.

                                    A couple of key moments boosted Kottke's fame: first, being threatened with legal
                                    action by Sony for breaking news about a TV show, but most notably quitting his
                                    web-design job and going solo three years ago. A host of 'micropatrons' and readers
                                    donated cash to cover his salary, but these days he gets enough advertising to pay
                                    the bills. He continues to plug away at the site as it enters its 10th year.</p>

                            <h1>Dooce</h1><br><br>
                            <blog>
                                <p>One of the best-known personal bloggers (those who provide more of a diary than a
                                    soapbox or reporting service), Heather Armstrong has been writing online since 2001.
                                    Though there were personal websites that came before hers, certain elements
                                    conspired to make Dooce one of the biggest public diaries since Samuel Pepys's
                                    (whose diary is itself available, transcribed in blog form, at Pepysdiary.com).
                                    Primarily, Armstrong became one of the first high-profile cases of somebody being
                                    fired for writing about her job. After describing events that her employer - a
                                    dotcom start-up - thought reflected badly on them, Armstrong was sacked. The
                                    incident caused such fierce debate that Dooce found itself turned into a verb that
                                    is used in popular parlance (often without users realising its evolution): 'dooced -
                                    to be fired from one's job as a direct result of one's personal website'.

                                    Behind Dooce stands an army of personal bloggers perhaps not directly influenced by,
                                    or even aware of, her work - she represents the hundreds of thousands who decide to
                                    share part of their life with strangers.

                                    Armstrong's honesty has added to her popularity, and she has written about work,
                                    family life, postnatal depression, motherhood, puppies and her Mormon upbringing
                                    with the same candid and engaging voice. Readers feel that they have been brought
                                    into her life, and reward her with their loyalty. Since 2005 the advertising revenue
                                    on her blog alone has been enough to support her family.</p>
